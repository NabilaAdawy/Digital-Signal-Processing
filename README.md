# Digital-Signal-Processing

The goal of the course is to present mathematical foundations of signal processing altogether with practical experience to design finite and infinite impulse response filters. The course is aimed to provide basic mathematic knowledge and practical skills needed for further studies of applied signal processing and digital signal processing from engineering as well as from mathematical perspective.

## Learning outcomes 

- Know basics of the mathematical theory of:
  - Discrete-time Fourier Transformation (DTFT)
  - Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT)
  - Fast Discrete Fourier Transformation (FDFT)
  - Fourie series.
- Understand relations between:
  - Analog and Digital signals
  - Continuous and Discrete signals.
  - Discrete signals and their convolution.
  - Discrete systems and Filters,
  - Impulse and Frequency domains.
- Get practical experience with mathematical package SciLab/Octave in digital signal processing and filter design.
