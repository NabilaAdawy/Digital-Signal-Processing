# Digital-Signal-Processing

The goal of the course is to present mathematical foundations of signal processing altogether with practical experience to design finite and infinite impulse response filters. The course is aimed to provide basic mathematic knowledge and practical skills needed for further studies of applied signal processing and digital signal processing from engineering as well as from mathematical perspective.

## Learning outcomes 

- Know basics of the mathematical theory of:
  - Discrete-time Fourier Transformation (DTFT)
  - Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT)
  - Fast Discrete Fourier Transformation (FDFT)
  - Fourie series.
- Understand relations between:
  - Analog and Digital signals
  - Continuous and Discrete signals.
  - Discrete signals and their convolution.
  - Discrete systems and Filters,
  - Impulse and Frequency domains.
- Get practical experience with mathematical package SciLab/Octave in digital signal processing and filter design.

## First Home Assignment
Task 1: was about Noise Reduction. 
Task 2: was about Image Compression.

## Second Home Assignment
Filter Implementation:
- Moving Average Filter
- The Window Method:
• the Bartlett window
• the Blackman window
• the Hamming window
• the Hann window

## End Semester Colloquium
At the end of the semester I participated with a presentation with the topic **"Creation of an Image of a Black Hole"** and the **role of DSP** to reach this image.

Abstract: Black holes do not reflect or emit electromagnetic waves because of the enormous gravity of the black hole does not let anything including light, escape from it. so it can only be tracked with the help of spatial telescopes and special tools. The Event Horizon Telescope, which detects radio frequencies, picks this up and registers it as a bright halo around the black hole. The final image is the result of several individual shots averaged together
